This plugin has a command for dumping detailed version info (zr_version) based
on info from a automatically generated file (hgversion.h.inc).

There's a script that generate this file and must be executed every time before
compiling:

    Linux: updateversion.sh
    Windows: updateversion.bat (Executes updateversion.sh using Cygwin)

Mercurial (or TortoiseHG) must be installed for this script to work. If you
don't have Mercurial, there's an option to disable version info. In
zombiereloaded.sp there's a line like this:

    #define ADD_VERSION_INFO

To disable it, comment that line like this:

    //#define ADD_VERSION_INFO

Then you should be able to compile without hgversion.h.inc.

On linux use the makefile to compile since that one will do most of the work.
Make sure you clean any existing builds before compiling:

    make clean
    make

For compiling on windows, run:

    compile.bat
