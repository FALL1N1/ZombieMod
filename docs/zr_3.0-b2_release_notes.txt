Release Notes For Changes In Beta 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Almost all known issues is now fixed. Beta 2 is a result of six months of work
on our spare time, which is pretty good in our opinion. There's a few new
features and some changes. These are the major news (also see changelog below):

* Support for group authentication on admin commands, models and classes.
  See Admin Authentication (3.24) in the user manual for usage information.

* Class selections and other settings can be saved in cookies (stored in a
  database or a file on the server).

* Class editor for volumetric features. Modify class attributes on players in a
  certain area. This could be extra jump boost in some places, or lower knock
  back in tubes and vents. Note that this feature is still a work in progress.
  
  Documentation for this one isn't written yet. This syntax should help:
  zr_vol_add <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2> classedit <class attribute>=<value>
  
  This will make players run fast in a certain area (replace coordinates):
  zr_vol_add -492 -522 497 511 534 681 classedit speed=500

* Changed model list to Valve's key/values format (same as classes use). Now
  it's possible to separate models into different groups and teams.

* There's a compatibility fix in classes for servers with plugins that change
  models. "model_path" in a class can be set to "no_change" so model can be
  changed by another plugin than Zombie:Reloaded.

* The user manual is converted to a nice looking HTML manual with links for
  quick navigation. Don't forget to have a look at it, at least if you have
  problems.
  
  Troubleshooting section is updated with explanation of all error messages
  and some info about common problems. Otherwise look at the configuration
  section on how to configure every feature.
