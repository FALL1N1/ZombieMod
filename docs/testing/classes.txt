Test cases for the class system

Loading class config
====================
* Validate team requirements
    - At least one zombie and human marked as default
    - No auth
    - No flags
* Validate invalid attribute values


Loading/saving classes on players
=================================
* Saving class to cookies. (Class index increased by one)
* Loading class on player when connecting
    - Loading from cookies with team mismatch. (Fall back to settings in cvar)
    - Loading from cookies with invalid class index. (Fall back to settings in cvar)
    - Loading with typo in zr_classes_default_*. (Fall back to default class)
    - Loading with no clean class. (Should be catched by team requirements validation)
