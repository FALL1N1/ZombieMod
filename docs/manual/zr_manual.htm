<h3>About Zombie:Reloaded</h3>

<p>Zombie:Reloaded is a SourceMod plugin made for Counter-Strike: Source where
humans and zombies fight for elimination of eachother. It's an open source clone
of <a href="http://www.zombiemod.com">ZombieMod</a> with lots of additional
features.</p>

<p>The game objectives will be changed into humans (counter-terrorists) versus
zombies (terrorists). Humans try to survive by camping, making barricades and
hiding. Zombies try to hit humans with their knife.</p>

<p>To balance the game, humans and zombies have different skills defined in
player classes.</p>

<h4>Common humans</h4>
<ul>
    <li>have huge amounts of ammo</li>
    <li>have bullets and explosions that push zombies away (knock back)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Common zombies</h4>
<ul>
    <li>have no weapons (only their knife)</li>
    <li>have much higher health</li>
    <li>run faster</li>
    <li>jump higher or longer</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>Initially there are no zombies. This gives humans some time to prepare
themself. After a random time the round has started, one or more humans are
turned into zombies.</p>

<p>There are three game modes in this game.</p>

<h4>Classic</h4>
<p>The classic game mode is just based on hiding, camping and barricading. It
works on any map, but zombie maps (prefixed with "zm_") should be used for
optimal balance and fun.</p>

<h4>Escape</h4>
<p>A second game mode is a escape from zombies to a safe place. Humans has to
run through various obstacles and reach a safe place within a certain amount of
time. Those who are left behind dies when the time is up. Escape maps are
required for this mode. These maps are commonly prefixed by "ze_".</p>

<h4>Riot</h4>
<p>The third game mode is a defense against a zombie riot (based on the
<a href="http://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=647040">Zombie
Riot</a> plugin by Greyscale). Bots are usually used as zombies in this game
mode but players may join the zombie team too. This game mode doesn't require
special maps, but get best results if it's played with zombie maps (prefixed
with "zm_" or "zr_").</p>

<p>In addition to the bots, each round is separated into days with different
difficulty level. Humans advance a day by surviving a round. If they loose they
will go back one day. Each day is a bit more difficult than the last one, where
there are more zombies to kill.</p>
